# Merge Resolution Report

## Conflict Scenario Description

During the development of the secure user management API, two parallel development branches were created to implement different features:

### Branch A: Authentication & Input Validation
- Implemented JWT-based authentication system
- Added comprehensive input validation for all endpoints
- Created token-based authorization middleware
- Added password strength requirements

### Branch B: Database Integration & User Management  
- Enhanced database schema with timestamps and constraints
- Implemented proper connection management and error handling
- Added user profile management endpoints
- Created comprehensive logging system

## Conflict Details

When attempting to merge these branches, conflicts occurred in the following areas:

### 1. Import Statements Conflict
**File:** `app.py` (Lines 1-15)

**Branch A added:**
```python
import jwt
from functools import wraps
from werkzeug.exceptions import BadRequest
```

**Branch B added:**
```python
import logging
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```

### 2. Application Configuration Conflict
**File:** `app.py` (Lines 20-30)

**Branch A added:**
```python
JWT_SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('JWT_SECRET_KEY', secrets.token_hex(32))
app.config.update(
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True,
    SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True
)
```

**Branch B added:**
```python
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

### 3. User Creation Function Conflict
**File:** `app.py` (Lines 80-120)

Both branches modified the `create_user()` function with different enhancements:
- Branch A: Added JWT token generation and validation
- Branch B: Added timestamp tracking and improved error handling

## Resolution Approach

### Strategy: Intelligent Combination
Rather than choosing one branch over another, I implemented an intelligent merge that preserves all valuable functionality from both branches.

### Resolution Decisions

#### 1. Import Consolidation
**Decision:** Combined all imports from both branches and organized them logically
```python
# Standard library imports
import os
import secrets
import logging
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from functools import wraps

# Third-party imports
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, session
import sqlite3
import bcrypt
import jwt
from werkzeug.exceptions import BadRequest
```

**Rationale:** All imports are necessary for the combined functionality

#### 2. Configuration Merge
**Decision:** Integrated both JWT configuration and logging setup
```python
# Configure secure logging (from Branch B)
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('app.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

app = Flask(__name__)

# Security configuration (from Branch A)
app.secret_key = os.environ.get('FLASK_SECRET_KEY', secrets.token_hex(32))
JWT_SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('JWT_SECRET_KEY', secrets.token_hex(32))

app.config.update(
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True,
    SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True,
    SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE='Lax',
    PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME=timedelta(hours=1)
)
```

**Rationale:** Both logging and JWT configuration are essential for a production-ready application

#### 3. Function Enhancement Integration
**Decision:** Created a comprehensive `create_user()` function incorporating both branches' improvements

**From Branch A (Authentication):**
- Input validation with BadRequest exceptions
- Password strength requirements
- JWT token generation capabilities

**From Branch B (Database Management):**
- Timestamp tracking with `created_at` field
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Proper database connection management

**Combined Result:**
```python
@app.route('/users', methods=['POST'])
def create_user():
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        validate_input(data, ['username', 'password'])  # Branch A
        
        username = data.get('username').strip()
        password = data.get('password')
        
        # Password strength validation (Branch A)
        if len(password) < 8:
            return jsonify({"error": "Password must be at least 8 characters long"}), 400
        
        # Secure password hashing
        salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
        hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)
        
        conn = get_db_connection()
        
        try:
            # Database insertion with timestamp (Branch B)
            conn.execute(
                "INSERT INTO users (username, password, created_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
                (username, hashed_password, datetime.utcnow().isoformat())
            )
            conn.commit()
            
            # Secure logging (Branch B)
            logger.info(f"User created: {username}")
            
            return jsonify({"message": "User created successfully", "username": username}), 201
            
        except sqlite3.IntegrityError:
            return jsonify({"error": "Username already exists"}), 409
        finally:
            conn.close()
            
    except BadRequest as e:  # Branch A error handling
        return jsonify({"error": str(e)}), 400
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error creating user: {e}")  # Branch B logging
        return jsonify({"error": "Internal server error"}), 500
```
